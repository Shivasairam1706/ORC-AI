# ORC AI: Autonomous Workflow Orchestration System

## Project Description

ORC AI represents an innovative approach to **autonomous workflow orchestration**, leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, specifically **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** like **Neo4j**. The system is designed to **dynamically manage and optimize complex data pipelines** across platforms such as Apache Airflow and Autosys. It moves beyond traditional, static workflow automation by embedding intelligent, dynamic decision-making directly into the orchestration layer. ORC AI functions as a "conductor", coordinating diverse AI and non-AI services and utilizing a robust tool-use framework to reason, plan, and execute tasks.

The system provides **comprehensive monitoring and observability**, supports **explainable reasoning** via the knowledge graph, and adheres to **MLOps best practices**. Built with a modular and scalable architecture, ORC AI aims to enhance efficiency, agility, and accuracy in enterprise operations. The project emphasizes open-source technologies and is committed to community engagement.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous & Dynamic Orchestration**: AI-driven system adapting to real-time data and unforeseen conditions for dynamic pipeline management.
*   **AI Agent Core**: Includes Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and dynamic tool selection and execution.
*   **Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)**: Stores workflow dependencies, metadata, and historical data for contextual understanding, complex querying, impact analysis, and explainable reasoning.
*   **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing enterprise workflow orchestrators, primarily focusing on Apache Airflow for the prototype.
*   **Comprehensive Observability**: Provides real-time monitoring and visibility using **Prometheus** for metrics collection, **Grafana** for visualization and dashboards, and **OpenTelemetry** for application instrumentation and tracing.
*   **Explainable AI**: The knowledge graph enables precise tracking of how decisions are derived, enhancing trust and auditability.
*   **MLOps Best Practices**: Adherence to principles of continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), versioning, and automated testing for models and workflows.
*   **Modular & Scalable Architecture**: Designed with distinct components for flexibility, fault tolerance, and scalability.
*   **Open Source Focus**: Built upon and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.

## Technology Stack

The ORC AI system leverages a variety of open-source technologies:

*   **Workflow Orchestration**: Apache Airflow (central platform), Prefect (secondary for ML pipelines).
*   **AI Components**: Large Language Models (LLMs), Python for custom logic and rule engines.
*   **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Slack, Apache Kafka (for event streaming).
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker (for containerization), Kubernetes (for production orchestration), PostgreSQL (Airflow metadata database), Redis (Message Broker for Celery Executor).
*   **Security**: Keycloak (for IAM).
*   **UI**: Streamlit (for interactive dashboards).
*   **Primary Language**: Python.

## Getting Started

For rapid prototyping and local development, a **Dockerized environment** is highly recommended. The setup typically includes containers for Airflow services (Webserver, Scheduler, Worker), a PostgreSQL database for Airflow metadata, a Neo4j instance for the knowledge graph, and a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana.

Refer to the `docker-compose.yml` example (as described in the sources) and detailed setup instructions for setting up the local environment.

## Contributing

ORC AI is intended as an open-source project with a commitment to community engagement. Contributions are welcomed through various pathways, including developing Airflow providers, Prefect integrations, and Neo4j knowledge templates.

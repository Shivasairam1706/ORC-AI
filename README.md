# ORC AI: Autonomous Workflow Orchestration with Intelligent Agents

ORC AI is a pioneering AI agent for **autonomous workflow orchestration**, initially targeting **Apache Airflow** and later expanding to platforms like **Autosys**. ORC AI’s core concept is to embed intelligent, dynamic decision-making into the orchestration layer, moving beyond traditional, static automation. It acts as a “conductor,” coordinating AI and non-AI services using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a tool-use framework.

## Goals and Value Proposition

- **Transform Enterprise Operations:** Increase efficiency, agility, and accuracy by automating and optimizing complex workflows.
- **Tackle Complex Challenges:** Address problems such as real-time fraud detection and adaptive supply chain management—scenarios that static automation cannot handle.
- **Redefine Human-AI Collaboration:** Enable explainable, contextual, and adaptive orchestration, making human-AI collaboration natural and effective.

## Architecture Overview

**ORC AI** features a modular, extensible architecture with three main layers:
```text
podman/
├── baseline/                # Or docker/ if using docker-compose
├── data/              # For raw/processed data, synthetic data.
│   ├── bronze/        # raw data, unrefined data.
│   └── silver/        # preprocessed data.
├── code/              # For DAGs, AI agent code, utility scripts.
├── model/             # For LLM weights, model configurations, saved models.
├── test/              # For unit, integration, and data quality tests.
├── temp/              # For temporary files and logs [36-40]
├── docker-compose.yml     # Or equivalent Podman Compose file. For multi container deployment.
├── requirements.txt       # For python packages
├── entrypoint.txt         # For python packages
├── Dockerfile             # custom python, pyspark image
└── .env                   # Holds the environment variable and credentials.
```
> **Note:**
> I am using Podman as the containerization tool for this project. However, the code is fully compatible with Docker and can be deployed using Docker without any modifications.


### AI Agent Core

- Handles reasoning, planning, dynamic tool use, and decision-making.
- Uses LLMs for cognitive capabilities and a tool-use framework for interacting with external systems.


### Knowledge Graph

- Provides contextual understanding, manages workflow dependencies, and enables explainable reasoning.
- Enhances LLM accuracy with GraphRAG and supports dynamic schema inference using LLMs.
- Built on **Neo4j**.


### Workflow Orchestration Layer

- Leverages **Apache Airflow** for executing decisions, managing tasks, and reliability.
- Integrates with **Prefect** and **Dask** for ML workflows and parallel computation.

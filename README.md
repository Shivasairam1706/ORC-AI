# ORC AI: Autonomous Workflow Orchestration with Intelligent Agents

ORC AI is a pioneering AI agent for **autonomous workflow orchestration**, initially targeting **Apache Airflow** and later expanding to platforms like **Autosys**. ORC AI’s core concept is to embed intelligent, dynamic decision-making into the orchestration layer, moving beyond traditional, static automation. It acts as a “conductor,” coordinating AI and non-AI services using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a tool-use framework.

## Goals and Value Proposition

- **Transform Enterprise Operations:** Increase efficiency, agility, and accuracy by automating and optimizing complex workflows.
- **Tackle Complex Challenges:** Address problems such as real-time fraud detection and adaptive supply chain management—scenarios that static automation cannot handle.
- **Redefine Human-AI Collaboration:** Enable explainable, contextual, and adaptive orchestration, making human-AI collaboration natural and effective.
